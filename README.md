# Breast-Cancer-Classification-with-IRRCNN-on-BreakHis-Dataset
A complete and independent implementation of the model from scratch, fully developed by myself following the original paper. The model is designed for breast cancer classification from histopathological images and trained and evaluated on the BreakHis dataset. The official code from the paper is not publicly available.
